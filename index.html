<h1>This is My First Attempt in Web Design</h1>
	<p>I wanted to try this new shift in career as a web designer <br>
	because it is time to move away from maintance tech and into something different<br>
	in order to be able to have the money to buy property.</p>
	
<h2> How am I doing so far?</h2>
	<p> It has been boring. I kept falling asleep because it's boring and it takes time <br>
	to learn and practice on this.  But my ultimate goal is for understanding and knowledge<br>
	so that I be able to get a job doing entry level web design or web developement or front end web.
